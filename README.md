# Project Title

Brief description of your project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
````

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If not, you can download and install them from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository URL]
cd [repository name]
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To run the application in development mode, execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite server. By default, the application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate a `dist` directory with the compiled assets.

### Running Production Build Locally

If you want to test the production build on your local machine, you can use:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve the content of the `dist` directory on a local web server, typically at `http://localhost:5000`.
